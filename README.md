# Lonely blocks
Simple 2D engine with physics.

External libraries:
* [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org)

## What does it has inside?
Well, engine is quite simple now, so it features:
* Impulse-based physics engine (no, I'm not very-very smart, so at the moment it works with AABBs only)
* Raycasting (not very efficient, but I'm working on it)
* Component-based game objects (I stole this idea from [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com))
* Alas, that's all
